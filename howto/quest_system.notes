How does the questing system work?

1) There's a character_progress.tab file in the character_files directory.
This stores all of the character's progress WRT different quests.
2) There must be an entry for a map's map_quest[] files in maps.cfg
3) The map_quest array element must point to a quest functions script in the map's respective map_functions directory.
4) map_tools.sh sources the quest functions appropriate for the map the character is on
5) each map's map_function conditions (found in the map's respective map_functions script) is responsible for marking the areas, or triggers, on the map that cause the function in the map's quest script to run.
eg. if character is in pallet town and is standing on element (4,8) then the pallet_town_functions.sh calls the character_falls_down_hole function which was sourced from the pallet_town_quests.sh script.
