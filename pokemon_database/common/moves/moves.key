Notes: A value of NULL indicates that the field doesn't apply for that move. Eg. Growl has a power of NULL because Growl doesnt make use of the power value, the move doesnt make use of the damage formula.
Similarly Growth has an accuracy of NULL as it doesn't use the accuracy formula under any circumstances.
