moveID | counterVariable | playerID

move scripts write to the moveTicks file only if the supplied argument to the move script is 0.

The counterVariable is used as an argument for the move script, giving different effects when provided.

At the end of every battle loop if there's a line present in the moveTicks.tab file it gets written to the
actionStack.
After writing to the actionStack the counterVariable in the moveTicks file ticks down by 1.
If at this point it becomes 0, that line is cleared from the moveticks file.
