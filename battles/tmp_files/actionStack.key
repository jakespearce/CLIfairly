actionID	priority	variable	playerID

tab separated
actionID: 1 = attack 2 = item 3 = run 4 = swap pokemon out
Note: Only the NPC uses the stack for 2 item and 4 swapping pokemon out
priority: the action with the highest priority gets executed first
variable: refers to a script. eg. when actionID = 1 (attack) and variable = 15 (the moveID of cut) it means we'll run 15.sh which is the Cut script
playerID = NPC or PC
